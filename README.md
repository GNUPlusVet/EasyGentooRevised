# Welcome to Easy Gentoo!
A revised version of [Pascal3366's](https://github.com/Pascal3366) [EasyGentoo](https://github.com/Pascal3366/EasyGentoo) I made with the help of [Ungentoo](https://github.com/ungentoo)<br>
I noticed that [Pascal's](https://github.com/Pascal3366) script was very buggy and outdated, so I decided to revise it!<br>
If you find any bugs please report them!<br><br>
